### Hello, I'm Kenton Vizdos ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 17 y/o rising senior in high school in Richmond, VA! As of now, I'm studying Web Dev (mainly w/ NodeJS) while (sometimes) writing on my blog at https://blog.kentonvizdos.com and tweeting at https://twitter.com/kvizdos. Right now, I'm working on PRAUXY (a proxy system with simple authentication at its core) and PRAUXYGO (a tablet IDE). You can check out my official portfolio page @ https://kentonvizdos.com
